#### Control flow
# Boolean control flow

# Opening and reading a file
# Use the "with" context manager keyword

# Writing a file out
with open('output.csv', 'w') as output_pointer:

#### Functions
# 'def' keyword flags Python that the following block is a function
def function1(argument1, argument2):
    # Functions are passed arguments
    # So the name is very important, as Python does not perform type checking
    # For example, strings can be added but not divided
    print(f"{argument1} ::: {argument2}")
    # By default, Python requires the "return" keyword or will return "None"

def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Functions are "stateless" and "scoped"
numerical_arg = 1
def stateless_function(numerical_arg):
    print(f"I got a numerical argument: {numerical_arg}")
    numerical_arg = numerical_arg + 1

# State must be returned from a function

# Function variables are scoped, but can be inherited from the environment
# Note that functions don't require arguments
value = 1
def add_and_report():
    value += 1
    print(f"LOCAL Value: {value}")
print(f"GLOBAL Value: {value}")

# The 'global' keyword can be used to persist variables, 
# but can cause problems as a codebase grows
global_value = 1
def add_global():
    global global_value
    global_value += 1
    print(f"LOCAL Value (with global keyword): {global_value}")

print(f"GLOBAL Value (with global keyword): {global_value}")

#### Objects
# Defined using the 'class' keyword
class MyAddingObject:

    # Classes can have 'class variables' and 'class methods'
    classAttribute = 'AddingObject'
    # We will not worry about class methods here

    # Objects have a constructor method called __init__
    def __init__(self, num1, num2):
        self.number1 = num1

#### Packages
# Python has many packages by default, called the "stdlib" (standard library)
# There is also a standard package manager for 
# handling external dependecies, called `pip`

# The standard library package for interacting with the
# operating system is os
import os
# For example, allow all users to run a script in their home
# directories by asking the OS what a user shortcut is
# In Linux/Mac, this is "~" or "$HOME". On Windows, it is %USERPROFILE%.
my_home_dir = os.path.expanduser("~/")
print(f"My home directory is: {my_home_dir}")

# AI packages rely on common math packages
import scipy
# Imports can be aliased
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
# This is true of AI/ML packages as well
import sklearn as skl
# We can also import only the components we are interested in
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
